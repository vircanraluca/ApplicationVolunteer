# ApplicationVolunteer

This is a web-based Volunteer Management System built using Vue.js and Vuetify for a modern and responsive user interface. The application communicates with a RESTful API developed using Node.js and Express, ensuring seamless interaction between the frontend and backend. User data and application state are managed in Google Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database offering real-time synchronization and scalability. The platform supports three types of users: Volunteers, Organizations, and Administrators, each with distinct, role specific functionality: 
•Volunteers can browse available events, apply to participate, and add selected events directly to their personal calendars for better planning and reminders. They also receive updates and can interact with an AI-powered chatbot for assistance. 
•Organizations can create, manage, view applicant details, approve or reject volunteer applications, and monitor participation statistics. . 
•Administrators oversee the platform as a whole. They can manage user accounts, moderate content, approve organization profiles, and ensure that events comply with platform guidelines. Admins also have access to analytical dashboards for monitoring system usage and performance. This project demonstrates a robust full-stack architecture with real-time data handling, role-based access control, cloud integration, and AI-driven assistance — all tailored to streamline and enhance community engagement through volunteering
